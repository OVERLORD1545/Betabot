# Basic setup for Postman application

## Getting the Postman application

Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. Postman's features simplify each step of building an API and
streamline collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster. For our use case we will use it to become familiar with
the api.swgoh.help API.

It can be downloaded [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

### How to use these files

This folder contains two JSON files that can be imported into the Postman application.

The first file is 'SWGOH API.postman_environment_template.json'. This file should be imported into Postman first since
it creates a separate environment for requests to the api.swgoh.help API. Before importing the file you should edit it
for your specific api.swgoh.help username and password.

```		
                {
			"key": "USERNAME",
			"value": "API_USERNAME_GOES_HERE",
			"enabled": true
		},
		{
			"key": "PASSWORD",
			"value": "API_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE",
			"enabled": true
		}
```

The second file is 'api.swgoh.help.postman_collection.json'. This file should be imported into the new environment
created by the import above. This Postman Collection file contains a few simple example requests to help get you started
working with the api.swgoh.help API.

For more information about importing configuration into the Postman application, please see their online
documentation [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/)
.

The imported Postman Collection provides an example of how to:

- get a list of all the available characters and ships a player could possibly obtain
- get the complete guild membership of a list of player allycodes
- get the complete player data for a list of allycodes

**CAUTION**: the api.swgoh.help API has rate limits and can become overloaded during heavy use. It is best to limit the
number of allycodes sent in a single list to 20 or less.
